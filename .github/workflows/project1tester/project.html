	   <h3> How Search engines work:</h3>
	</div>
		<div>
			<p> The way a search engine works is they build a wealth of knowledge of documents, images, and content of anything a person can think of, then create an index to access that information better to sort out information.
			Then, the second job of the engine is to list the answer to a question or anything related to the inquiry of someone using said search engine. </p>
		</div>
			<div>
				<h4> Importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags:</h4>
			</div>
				<div>
					<p> The reason keywords and descriptions as meta tags are essential is simple: they help both the user of the search engine and the search engine quickly find the information they are looking for. 
					Because when a user is looking for an answer, they are looking for select words in the content to find their answer.
					The Search engine does the same thing with a description meta tag; it's like highlighting a keyword in information.
					</p>
				</div>
					<div>
						<h5> Four elements that comprise writing relevant content links: </h5>
					</div>
						 <div>
							<p> 1. A link should be for a user not the search engine because if a a site says it has infomation about duck for engine but then when a user clicks on the site and it about washer machine thats a bad link.
							    2. A link should have a clear heading hierarchy to make it easier for a user to read.
							    3. A link should be reachable from every page from a static link.
							    4. A link must have a keywords and description meta tag to better help users and search engines.
							</p>
							</div>     
   								<div>
									<h6> Good heading hierarchy:</h6>
								</div>
									<div>   
									<p> What good heading hierarchy is writing heading from more import to less import with heading shrink with importans.
										and example of this would be like a text book it would tell about an event, the time, the people, then effect. 
										This is Done because to help make the content more readable andd so a user can quickly find the infomation they need.
